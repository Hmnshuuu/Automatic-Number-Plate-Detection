Project: Automated License Plate Detection using YOLO

Tech Stack: PyTorch, Python, YOLO, Object Detection, Computer Vision

Project Details:

-Utilized a dataset of 433 pre-annotated images for training.
-Processed XML annotation files and converted them into YOLO format for compatibility.
-Enhanced and trained a YOLOv8 model over 100 epochs to    optimize detection performance.
-Achieved significant metrics, including mAP@0.5-0.7 and mAP@0.5-0.95.
-Deployed the trained model using Streamlit for real-time license plate detection.
